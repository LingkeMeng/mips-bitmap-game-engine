# mips-bitmap-game-engine
This project implements a complete 2D platformer engine in pure MIPS assembly.

Features include:

- 256×256 bitmap display rendering
- Pixel-level sprite drawing and erasing
- Gravity, jumping, and falling physics
- Horizontal and vertical collision detection
- Tile-based platform rendering
- Real-time keyboard input handling
- Modular subroutines for movement, physics, and rendering

The project demonstrates low-level systems programming concepts such as:

- Memory-mapped I/O
- Register-level state management
- Manual stack discipline
- Control-flow design without high-level abstractions
